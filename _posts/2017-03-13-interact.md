title: Multi-line statements in PDB
---

A common way of programming/debugging in Python is to insert an

```import pdb; pdb.set_trace()```

right before a line of code that's either poorly understood or
is causing some problem. Then when you run your application
and it pauses, you will essentially have an
interactive session with your entire state available to you, 
and you can try things out in the REPL (read-eval-print-loop, 
essentially interactive mode.)

Unfortunately, this does not allow for multi-line statements
to be executed. For that, you can do the following

```
(pdb) import code
(pdb) code.interact(local=dict(globals(), **locals()))
```

and you'll see 

```
Python 2.7.6 (default, Oct 26 2016, 20:30:19) 
[GCC 4.8.4] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
(InteractiveConsole)
>>> 
```

Yay! Note that the StackOverflow response [1] (from where I learned this trick)
lacks the `globals()` call which will make sure that you don't have to 
reimport everything again.
