title: Torsocks and youtube-dl
---

Just a quick trail of crumbs: if by chance you've been using torsocks and youtube-dl together on Ubuntu and all requests
end up just hanging until you get a `MemoryError`, it's likely due to an incompatibility between torsocks and
recent versions of ffmpeg.

Do a `torsocks --version` and if you're running anything less than 2.2.0 then install [this](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/zesty/amd64/torsocks/2.2.0-1).
