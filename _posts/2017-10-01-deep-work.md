title: Notes on Cal Newport's _Deep Work_
---

3-4 hours a day of focused work is probably the maximum that most can accomplish

students at the top of the class work less than the students in the tier below; in interviews they
express the importance of intensity when they are working

"follow your passion" is deeply flawed

people assume that _their_ knowledge work cannot become a source of meaning; too focused on job
description

blacksmith/wheelwright were able to extract meaning from their work due to the skill and appreciation
inherent in craftsmanship

use the chain method

brian chappell: would wake up at 5:30am, work on thesis until 7:30am, then go to work, finished with
with dissertation obligations for the day

became capable of generating drafts of thesis chapters at a rate of one chapter every two or three 
weeks

rowling: checking into hotel, grand gesture 

recovery is extremely important: leave the office at 5:30pm

get ready for the feelings of discomfort with the work

shutdown ritual, no email at night

adam marlin: late convertee to judaism, increased ability to concentrate elsewhere from studying talmud

block email/slack for extended intervals

do not use the internet for entertainment

_How to Live on 24 Hours a Day_: "man persists on looking as the hours from 10-6 as 'the day'"

Bennett suggests on seeing his 16 hours of time as a day within a day

put more thought and planning into your leisure time

people are capable of performing continuous, challenging activity; "they do not tire like an arm or a leg"

only need change, not rest
